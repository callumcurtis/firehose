# TODO

This document contains the informal, low-level TODO items that I notice
and make note of for later. For the high-level TODO items, see the
[plan](./docs/plan.md).

- [x] Research data engineering and distributed system best practices
- [x] Create a design document for the project (architecture, tech, features, KPIs)
- [x] Expand this todo list using the design document
- [ ] TODO1: Swap to using cachix/devenv to compose environments
- [ ] Add a more accurate description to the GitHub project
- [ ] Consider swapping to a more descriptive project name
- [ ] Work through the increments in the [plan](./docs/plan.md)
