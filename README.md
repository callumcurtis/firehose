A distributed system with advanced data flows.

## Motivation

As the scale of data continues to grow and developments in AI promise to extract even greater value
from data, applications must increasingly scale horizontally to keep up. In a distributed world,
having the skills to build and reason about data-intensive, distributed systems will be critical.
I aim to improve some of these skills through this project.

## Objectives

At a very high level, my objectives for this project are the following.
- Build a distributed system consisting of multiple microservices
- Communicate, store, and process large quantities of data
- Use a variety of data engineering techniques to solve unique data challenges for different use cases

To accomplish these objectives, I'll need to decide what to build, why, and how.
To answer these questions, some [research](./docs/research.md) will be needed.
