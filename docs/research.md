# Research

## Approach

I need to be purposeful about my research. There's a lot to learn from reading, but more to learn from building.
Unfortunately, it won't be worthwhile for me to try and learn everything about distributed systems and data engineering
before getting started - I need to focus on some subset of the information.

My approach will be to focus on Netflix's data architecture. They have world-class engineering and have grown over enough
time to have gained plenty of lessons and learnings. I'll study up on their decisions, wins, and mistakes, select some interesting
interesting technologies to use and challenging problems to solve, and get to work.
